## ***.themes/***

I'm personally using ***Catppuccin Mocha Standart*** theme and customized top bar enriched with gnome extensions

## ***.config/***

Config folder includes assets of ***Catppuccin*** theme

## ***extensions/***

It includes gnome-extensions that I'm using for my daily use of Pop_OS:

- User Theme
- Dash to Dock
- Pano Clipboard
- Coverflow Alt+Tab
- Transparent Top Bar
- Rounded Corners
- Compiz Windows Effect
- Logo Menu
- Space Bar
- Aylur's Widgets
- Extensions List

## ***wallpapers/***

I also created folder for interesting wallpapers that I saved

## ***Terminal***

I'm using ZSH for my daily user shell. As for scripting I'm still using Bash and I think it's the best one to use for shell scripting or linux automation.

For best powerlevel10k theme experience, we have to install MesloLGS Regular font:
- https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/blob/master/font.md

As for gnome-terminal, I'm also using Catppuccin theme where you can also install from:
- https://github.com/catppuccin/gnome-terminal

Best way to setup zsh, oh-my-zsh, powerlevel10k, and basic plugins:
